# PMSSS Digital Scholarship Platform

---

## 📘 Background

The **Prime Minister's Special Scholarship Scheme (PMSSS)** is a national initiative designed to promote higher education by providing financial support to deserving students across India. Traditionally, the scholarship process relies on paper-based workflows, which are time-consuming, error-prone, and environmentally unsustainable.

To address these challenges, the **SAG Bureau** seeks to digitize the entire process — from document submission to verification and payment disbursement — using a web-based platform that ensures speed, transparency, and data security.
